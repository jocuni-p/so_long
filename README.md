# so_long
This project is a very small 2D game.
Its purpose is to make us work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements.
so_long will help us improve our skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.
We are going to use the 42' school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
The other goals are being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.


### MacOS
This program is created for Apple platforms because the compilation flags and the code key numbers are based on the Apple keyboards and MacOS. It can be easily adapted to a Linux system doing these small adaptations.


Execution command:
```
./so_long maps/map_name.ber

./so_long_bonus maps/map_name_bonus.ber
```
